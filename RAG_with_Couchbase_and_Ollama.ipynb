    "# Introduction \n",
    "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the backend database and [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for local LLM and embedding generation. We'll use the `gemma:latest` model for generating embeddings and `qwen3:8b` as the language model. Semantic search goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the context and meaning behind the words in a query, making it an essential tool for applications that require intelligent information retrieval. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch using local, private AI models."

This step is crucial because it optimizes our database for vector similarity search operations, allowing us to perform searches based on the semantic content of documents rather than just keywords. By creating or updating a Vector Search Index, we enable our search engine to handle complex queries that involve finding semantically similar documents using vector embeddings, which is essential for a robust semantic search engine.Creating search indexes placeholder text."

    "A vector store is where we'll keep our embeddings. Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the search engine converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."

    "## Perform Semantic Search\n",
    "Semantic search in Couchbase involves converting queries and documents into vector representations using an embeddings model. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored directly in Couchbase. When a query is made, Couchbase performs a similarity search by comparing the query vector against the stored document vectors. The similarity metric used for this comparison is configurable, allowing flexibility in how the relevance of documents is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, the search process begins by recording the start time, followed by executing the similarity_search_with_score method of the CouchbaseSearchVectorStore. This method searches Couchbase for the most relevant documents based on the vector similarity to the query. The search results include the document content and a similarity score that reflects how closely each document aligns with the query in the defined semantic space. The time taken to perform this search is then calculated and logged, and the results are displayed, showing the most relevant documents along with their similarity scores. This approach leverages Couchbase as both a storage and retrieval engine for vector data, enabling efficient and scalable semantic searches. The integration of vector storage and search capabilities within Couchbase allows for sophisticated semantic search operations without relying on external services for vector storage or comparison."

      "Two-time champion Peter Wright won his opening game at the PDC World Championship, while Ryan Meikle edged out Fallon Sherrock to set up a match against teenage prodigy Luke Littler. Scotland's Wright, the 2020 and 2022 winner, has been out of form this year, but overcame Wesley Plaisier 3-1 in the second round at Alexandra Palace in London. \"It was this crowd that got me through, they wanted me to win. I thank you all,\" said Wright. Meikle came from a set down to claim a 3-2 victory in his first-round match against Sherrock, who was the first woman to win matches at the tournament five years ago. The 28-year-old will now play on Saturday against Littler, who was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year and runner-up in the main award to athlete Keely Hodgkinson on Tuesday night. Littler, 17, will be competing on the Ally Pally stage for the first time since his rise to stardom when finishing runner-up in January's world final to Luke Humphries. Earlier on Tuesday, World Grand Prix champion Mike de Decker – the 24th seed - suffered a surprise defeat to Luke Woodhouse in the second round. He is the second seed to exit following 16th seed James Wade's defeat on Monday to Jermaine Wattimena, who meets Wright in round three. Kevin Doets recovered from a set down to win 3-1 against Noa-Lynn van Leuven, who was making history as the first transgender woman to compete in the tournament.\n",

      "The 54-year-old Wright only averaged 89.63 to his opponent's 93.77, but did enough to progress. Sporting a purple mohawk and festive outfit, crowd favourite 'Snakebite' showed glimpses of his best to win the first set and survived eight set darts to go 2-0 ahead. He lost the next but Dutchman Plaisier missed two more set darts in the fourth and Wright seized his opportunity. \"Wesley had his chances but he missed them and I took them,\" he said. \"He's got his tour card and he's going to be a dangerous player next year for all the players playing against him.\" Sherrock, 30, fought back from 2-1 down to force a decider against her English compatriot Meikle. She then narrowly missed the bull to take out 170 in the fourth leg before left-hander Meikle held his nerve to hit double 18 for a 96 finish to seal a hard-fought success. \"I felt under pressure from the start and to come through feels unbelievable,\" said Meikle. \"It's an unbelievable prize to play Luke here on this stage. It's the biggest stage of them all. I'm so happy.\" World number 81 Jeffrey de Graaf, who was born in the Netherlands but now represents Sweden, looked in trouble against Rashad Sweeting before prevailing 3-1. Sweeting, who was making history as the first player from the Bahamas to compete in the tournament, took the first set, but De Graaf fought back to clinch a second-round meeting with two-time champion Gary Anderson Germany's Ricardo Pietreczko, ranked 34, beat China's Xiaochen Zong 3-1 and will face Gian van Veen next.\n",

    "Couchbase and LangChain can be seamlessly integrated to create RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chains, enhancing the process of generating contextually relevant responses. In this setup, Couchbase serves as the vector store, where embeddings of documents are stored. When a query is made, LangChain retrieves the most relevant documents from Couchbase by comparing the query’s embedding with the stored document embeddings. These documents, which provide contextual information, are then passed to a generative language model within LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language model, equipped with the context from the retrieved documents, generates a response that is both informed and contextually accurate. This integration allows the RAG chain to leverage Couchbase’s efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, while LangChain handles the generation of responses based on the context provided by the retrieved documents. Together, they create a powerful system that can deliver highly relevant and accurate answers by combining the strengths of both retrieval and generation."
